"ADDITIONAL TERMS

Notwithstanding the terms of the Federal, State, and Local Taxes Clause, the contract price excludes all State and Local taxes levied on or measured by the contract or sales price of the services or completed supplies furnished under this contract. The Vendor shall state separately on its invoices taxes excluded from the fees, and the Customer agrees either to pay the amount of the taxes (based on the current value of the equipment) to the contractor or provide evidence necessary to sustain an exemption, in accordance with FAR 52.229-1 and FAR 52.229-3.  

The Anti-Assignment Act, 41 USC 6305, prohibits the assignment of Government contracts without the Government's prior approval.  Procedures for securing such approval are set forth in FAR 42.1204.

The vendor recognizes that Federal agencies are subject to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, which requires that certain information be released, despite being characterized as “confidential” by the vendor.

This Agreement, together with the underlying GSA Schedule Contract, Schedule Pricelist, and Purchase Order(s), sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties relating to the object hereof and merges all prior discussions and agreements of the matter hereof between them.  A negotiated purchase order would take precedence as the negotiated purchase order would demonstrate any changes to these terms to meet the ordering activity’s minimum needs.

User
(Four Categories)
A “User” for Company web products is defined as any individual person capable of sending HTTP requests to or from the Internet to be processed by a Company product, regardless of whether the individual is actively using the product at any given time. In such cases where multiple unique Users use the same workstation to
access the Internet, that workstation represents a single user.


A “User” for Company email products is defined as any  mail enabled account capable    of sending or receiving emails to or from the Internet to be processed by a Company product, regardless of whether the mailbox is actively using the product at any given time. This includes administrative mailboxes, for example, “do not reply”,
proxy, and customer service mailboxes.


For purposes of licensing compliance, an “Academic User” refers to the number of licenses required for Company academic-specific endpoint products licensed Per User. It is calculated as follows: Full-time faculty + Part-time faculty÷3 + Full-time staff + Part-time staff÷2 = Total number of licenses required. Students accessing
school-owned or leased computers do not need a license.


For  all  other  Company  Products,  a  “User”  is  defined  as  a  unique  individual  person within a company, organization, or other entity, where: (1) the entity has acquired a valid license(s) to use the product, and (2) the entity has authorized the particular individual person to use the product. For example, if the company has acquired 1,000 licenses of the product, and the company has authorized a particular individual to use the product, and that person falls within the aggregate pool of
people authorized to use the software, then they are a “User”, regardless of whether the individual is actively using the product at any given time.
